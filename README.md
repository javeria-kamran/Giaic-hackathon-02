# GIAIC-UI/UX Hackathon - Furniture E-Commerce Website

## 📖 Overview
The **GIAIC-UI/UX Hackathon** was an exciting challenge provided by our respected teachers. Participants were assigned Figma templates to transform into fully functional projects. I was tasked with **Template 4**, a 15-page design for a **Furniture E-Commerce Website**. The objective was to replicate the design with precision, ensuring a pixel-perfect and responsive implementation.

This project was built using **Next.js 15** and **Node.js**, leveraging the latest tools and technologies for modern web development.
